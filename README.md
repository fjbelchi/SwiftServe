SwiftServe
==========
An HTTP server written in Swift.

The main purpose is to create a server for serving JSON endpoints using Core Data.

Wish List
=========
SwiftServe is nowhere near complete. Some ofthe next items to include are:
* Authentication (basic, OAuth)
* Object-relational mapping for Core Data
* Registration and processing of REST endpoints

Bugs
====
* Memory leak, connection not removed from server.connections after it's closed

many more...and I am seeking a collaborator or two
